# Explainable Chat-Driven Loan Recommender System

This project implements an AI-powered system to predict loan approval decisions and provide users with clear, easy-to-understand explanations on why a loan was approved or rejected. It uses XGBoost for prediction, SMOTE for handling imbalanced data, and SHAP for generating feature importance explanations.

---

## Features

- Data preprocessing with handling missing values and encoding categorical variables  
- Balances training data using SMOTE to improve model fairness  
- Trains an XGBoost classifier for high-accuracy loan approval prediction  
- Generates explanations for each decision using SHAP values  
- Provides actionable advice for users based on model insights  
- Visualizes feature contributions with pie charts and SHAP summary plots
